# Setup
Setup based on which kind of probes are you going to use. If you don't understand, please read [Concepts and Designs](../concepts-and-designs/README.md) first.


**Important: Please choose the timezone on UI, make it matches the timezone of your OAP backend servers.**


## Download official releases
- Backend, UI and Java agent are Apache official release, you could find them at [Apache SkyWalking DOWNLOAD page](http://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/).

## Language agents in Service

- [Java agent](service-agent/java-agent/README.md). Introduce how to install java agent to your service, without change any codes.

The following agents and SDKs are compatible with the SkyWalking's formats and protocols, but maintained by the 3rd-party.
You could go to their project repositories to find out the releases and how to use them.
- [SkyAPM .NET Core agent](https://github.com/SkyAPM/SkyAPM-dotnet). See .NET Core agent project document for more details.
- [SkyAPM Node.js agent](https://github.com/SkyAPM/SkyAPM-nodejs). See Node.js server side agent project document for more details.
